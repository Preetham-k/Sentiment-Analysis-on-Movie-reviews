# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-reviews
Setiment Analysis ML Model is built for analysis the Movie reviews in IMDB

This is an outline of what i did in the project.

Simple Description : In the dataset, there are  movie reviews that are classified into either Positive or Negative. Using Multinomial Naive Bayes built a machine learning model
which could identify weather a review is postive or not. I worked out the following things in .ipynb file:

1.Data Collection : Read the dataset into Pandas Dataframe
2. Data Wrangling: removed unnecessary columns. Cleared NA values and coverted the text into simple means.
3. Vectorizing : Used Countvectorizer to convert the text into vectors.
4. Building the Model : Used MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES model for this DATASET
5. Prediction and Metrics : Predictions are made on test dataset and Metrics such as Accuracy are evaluated.
